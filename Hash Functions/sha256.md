# SHA-256

This SHA-256 script uses the same algorithm as SHA-256 in real life and so will produce the same results as its real life equivalent with some exceptions.

This program is different in that, because of limitations in Grey Hack, like the 1 million max list size, 3 bytes are allocated at the end of the last block instead of 8.
What this means for you is that if your input is a multiple of 56 to 61 (inclusive) characters long, then the final hash will differ from the real life counterpart.
This allows the max character length to be 124,997 and means that the algorithm is less likely to create another block for your message, which reduces hash computation time.

Each block takes about 0.55 seconds to be compressed, meaning you can calculate the time for hash to be finished using the following equation:

  `time â‰ˆ ceil(input.len/61)*(0.55)`
