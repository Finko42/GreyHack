# SHA-256

The SHA-256 script uses the same algorithm as SHA-256 in real life and so will produce the same results as its real life equivalent with some exceptions.

This program is different in that, because of limitations in Grey Hack, like the 1 million max list size, 4 bytes are allocated at the end of the last block instead of 8.
What this means for you is that if your input is a multiple of 55 to 59 (inclusive) characters long, then the final hash will differ from the real life counterpart.
This means that the algorithm is less likely to create another block for your message, which reduces hash computation time. These different hashes should be as secure as the others.

Each block (every 60 characters) takes about 0.035 seconds to be compressed.
